One of the typical usage of iOS UISegmentedControl is for switching between different switch view controllers. In simple words, UISegmentedControl is used to show or hide data based on selected category in the view controller.And Here, I’ve a created a demo on [How to Switch View Controllers Using iOS UISegmentedControl](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/switch-view-ios-uisegmentedcontrol/).
